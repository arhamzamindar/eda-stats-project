## PROBLEM STATEMEMT 
FinMan is a Financial Distribution company. Over the last 10 years, they have created an offline distribution channel across India. They sell Financial products to consumers by hiring agents in their network. These agents are freelancers and get commission when they make a product sale.


Overview of FinMan On-boarding process
The Managers at FinMan are primarily responsible for recruiting agents. Once a manager has identified a potential applicant, the would explain the business opportunity to the agent. Once the agent provides the consent, an application is made to FinMan to become an agent. This date is known as application_receipt_date.


In the next 3 months, this potential agent has to undergo a 7 day training at the FinMan branch (about Sales processes and various products) and clear a subsequent examination in order to become a FinMan agent.


The problem - Who are the best agents?
As is obvious in the above process, there is a significant investment which FinMan makes in identifying, training and recruiting these agents. However, there are a set of agents who do not bring in the expected resultant business.

Finman has approached you and asked you to  to analyse and observe the overall past recruitment data to help your client derive meaningful insights.
